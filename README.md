# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

This project is part of my NTI training and represents my **first Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model**.  
It focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the **MNIST dataset** using deep learning.

---

## Project Overview
- Built a CNN model from scratch using **TensorFlow/Keras**.  
- Trained the model on the **MNIST dataset** (60,000 training images, 10,000 test images).  
- Integrated a **Streamlit web application** to make predictions interactively by uploading or drawing digits.  

---

## Features
- Data preprocessing (grayscale, resizing, normalization).  
- CNN model with Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense layers.  
- Model evaluation with accuracy metrics.  
- Streamlit app for user interaction.

## Installation and Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Mirna-2Nageh/NTI_WEEK_1.git
   cd NTI_WEEK_1

2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate      # For Windows

   pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Train the model (if not already trained):

4. Run the Streamlit app:

## Results

* Achieved high accuracy on MNIST test data.
* Successfully built and deployed my **first CNN model**.
## Future Work

* Add more preprocessing techniques.
* Try more advanced CNN architectures.
* Deploy on cloud platforms.
